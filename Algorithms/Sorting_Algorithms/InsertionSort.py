'''
Before learning how to implement insertion sort in python, we must understand why the hack we use insertion sort
for sorting purpose. There are basically three main reasons we should use this algorithm for sorting:
1. It is one of the simplest and easy to implement sorting algorithm
2. It is very much efficient for small data values
3. It is adaptive in nature, which means that for a partially sorted array it is very much appropriate algorithm

class Solution:
    def __init__():
        pass
    def InsertionSort(arr: list):
        pass 



# Driver Code
def main():
    
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
