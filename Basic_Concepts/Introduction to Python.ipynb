    "#### What is Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is a general purpose, high level, object oriented, interpreted and easy to learn language. It was created by Sir Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. There are various version available for different platforms. Python is a widely used high level programming language. It is mostly used in field of Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, etc. Python is easy to learn and has a rich set of libraries available for use. We will be using Python 3.10.5 version, Jupyter notebook & Visual Studio Code in this Series of <b>Python for Data Science</b>."

    "Functions are reffered to as some sort of action which a programmer or developer perform while writing the code. Function in very simple terms, can be described as <i> A Machine which take something as input and produces some output as result.</i> Now that we have understood the concept of functions, let us understand the concept of argument. Arguments are the input to the function. In the hello world program, we have passed a string \"Hello, World from Python!!!\" as an argument to the print function. Functions are very useful in programming, they are the example of code reusablity. because we can reuse the same code for different purposes.\n",
